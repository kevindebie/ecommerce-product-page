# Frontend Mentor - E-commerce product page solution

This is a solution to the [E-commerce product page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://kevindebie.github.io/ecommerce-product-page](https://kevindebie.github.io/ecommerce-product-page/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Alpine.js
- Mobile-first workflow

### Notes

I deliberately chose to deviate from the design of Frontend Mentor on the following elements:
- Arrows on product page always visible
- Hover state of the add to cart button: I didn't like the hover state from Frontend Mentor, because it looked like a "disabled" state.
- Hover state of the plus and minus buttons: same reason as for the add to cart button.
